  NOTE: all these common functionalities don't require throwing an error.

  Not throwing error does not trigger the transaction rollback.
  All of these common functionalities are "read" heavy,
  meaning we don't actually need to throw an error, we can simply terminate
  the transaction succesfully even if we did not complete the full transaction.
  (Like creating, updating, or deleting an employee, as
  the only modifying functionality is after the common functionality "checks"
  business logic conditions)

  IF these common functions were modifying the data, then
  returning a `Result` would not be enough - you would need to actually
  **throw** an error for the transaction to roll back.
