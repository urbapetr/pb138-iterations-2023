/**

 * If it does not exist, use the first day of the last month and the last day
 * of last month as the `from` and `to` dates.
 * (both Day.js and date-fns provide such date setting functions, DO NOT
 * attempt to write that logic by yourself)
 *
 * In both cases, set the returned `from` date's time to `T00:00:00.000Z`,
 * and set the returned `to` date's time to `23:59:59.999Z`.
 *
 * In date-fns, this can be achieved via calling:
 * ```ts
 * import { format } from 'date-fns';
 *
 * // `data.interval.from` and `data.interval.to` are both types Date
 * // note: same can (and should) be applied to dates when `data.interval` is
 * //       not defined
 *
 * // formatted `from` value
 * const formattedFromDate = new Date(
 *   format(data.interval.from, 'yyyy-MM-dd') + 'T00:00:00.000Z',
 * );
 * // formatted `to` date
 * const formattedToDate = new Date(
 *   format(data.interval.to, 'yyyy-MM-dd') + 'T23:59:59.999Z',
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * We're sure Day.js provides an equivalent way of setting the date
 *
 * The `data.interval.from` and `data.interval.to` properties are INCLUSIVE
 *
 *
 * @param data optional object. If contained, specifies the desired number
 *             of hours which the employees have worked (to filter by),
 *             as well as the desired interval
 *             (if empty, last month is chosen as the interval)
 * @returns
 * \{
 *   from: Date,
 *   to: Date
 * }
 * with the `from` property's time set to `T00:00:00.000Z`
 * and the `to` property's time set to `23:59:59.999Z`
