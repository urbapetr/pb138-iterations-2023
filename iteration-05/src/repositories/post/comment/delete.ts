/**
 * @todo Write a query that deletes a comment if and only if the commenter
 * specified by the id in the function's parameter is the author of the comment
 * (also specified in the parameter by its id). Delete is implemented
 * as setting the `deletedAt` property
 *
 * Use Prisma's interactive transactions to obtain the comment in question
 * and throw an error if the comment is not created by the user, or the comment
 * has already been deleted
 *
 * Write TWO Prisma queries and other logic checks inside the pre-written
 * transaction
 *
 * Handle the situation where comment is not created by the user with id
 * passed in the parameter of the function by throwing with a custom message:
 * 'The specified user is not the author of the comment!'
 *
 * Handle the situation where comment has already been deleted by throwing
 * with a custom message:
 * 'The comment has already been deleted!'
 *
 * @throws (wrapped in the Result type) when the user with user id provided
 * via the function's parameter is not the post's author, or when the post
 * with id provided via the function's parameter does not exist,
 * or on any unexpected error
 *
 * @param data - data necessary for comment deletion
 * @returns - `Result.ok(Comment & {
 * post: PostAnonymized,
 * commenter: User,
 * })` on success
 *         - `Result.err(Error('The user is not the author of this comment!'))`
 *           if the user is not the author of this comment
 *         - `Result.err(Error('The comment has already been deleted!'))`
 *           if the comment has already been deleted
 *         - `Result.err(_)` - on all other failures
 *           (`_` meaning the original Prisma error)
