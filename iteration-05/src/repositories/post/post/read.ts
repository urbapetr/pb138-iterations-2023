 * @todo Write a query that finds a specific post and retrieves information
 * about it
 *
 * Write ONE Prisma query
 *
 * - The necessary data is provided in the data parameter.
 * - Check the result type to see what needs to be the output that is obtained
 *   by the Prisma query.
 *
 * Specification for the result:
 * 1. only obtain the comments that have not been deleted yet
 * 2. order all fields that obtain multiple records by their required
 *    `createdAt` field in descending order. Order the post history 
 *    by the `editedAt` property in descending order.
 * 3. only include "public" information about users -
 *    emails, avatars and user names
 *
 * Handle the situation where post does not exist anymore (has the `deletedAt`
 * property) by throwing with a custom message:
 * 'The post does not exist anymore!'
 *
 * @throws (wrapped in the Result type) when the post with the specified id
 * never existed, or when the post was deleted
 *
 * @param data - data necessary for getting the specified post
 * @returns `Result.ok(PostAnonymized & {
 * comments: { Comment & { commenter: UserWithoutSensitiveInformation } }[].
 * creator: UserWithoutSensitiveInformation,
 * history: PostEdit[]
 * })` on success
 *          `Result.err('The post does not exist anymore!')`
 *          when the post has been deleted
 *          `Result.err(_)` - on all other failures
 *          (`_` meaning the original Prisma error)
