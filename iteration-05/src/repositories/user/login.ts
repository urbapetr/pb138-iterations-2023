/**
 * @todo Write a query that "logs in" the user - retrieves user's `id`
 *
 * In real world, you would use the password's hash and the generated salt
 * to check, whether the hashed and salted user's input matches the hash
 * retrieved from the database. This would be done with a transaction.
 * For now, only a simple query suffices as this is not a demo of
 * how to do auth. It is just a function, that should
 * be implemented in the repository.
 *
 * Write only ONE Prisma query
 *
 *
 * @throws (wrapped by the Result type) when the user with specified
 * email address does not exist, or on any unexpected error
 *
 * @param data - email address
 * @returns - `Result.ok({ id: string })` on success
 *          - `Result.err(Error('The user has been deleted!'))`
 *            if the user has been deleted
 *          - `Result.err(_)` - on all other failures
 *            (`_` meaning the original Prisma error)
